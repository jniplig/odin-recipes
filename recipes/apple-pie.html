    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well! Serve hot or cold at family dinners or during the holidays, topped with whipped cream or ice cream, or alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.</p>
    
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
   <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed</li>

   <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>

   <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
   
   <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
   
   <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
   
   <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
   
   <li>¼ cup water</li>
   
   <li>1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <p>Step One</p>
    <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <p>Step Two</p>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <p>Step Three</p>
    <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    </li>
    <p>Step Four</p>
    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
